The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system, composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching over 2,300 kilometers. Located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia, it is the only living structure visible from space. The reef is known for its vibrant marine life, including species of fish, coral, mollusks, and turtles. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and faces threats from climate change, coral bleaching, and human activities.
